# Clojial

This is a full-stack Clojure(script) experiment of mine. Maybe if it turns out well I'll actually host it and use it as some sort of blog or something.

# Running it

You can run the server with

``` sh
$ clj -X clojial.core/run 
```

And the front end with

``` sh
$ npm i
$ npx shadow-cljs watch front-end
```
